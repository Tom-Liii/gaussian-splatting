# New implementation of Mask
- 通过一个MLP来学习mask的pattern(input: density ...)
# detact the change of boolean selection
- trace the change of selection among each pseudo merge and final merge
# how to implement the mlp?
- (10000 * n) tensor -> MLP -> (10000 * 2) tensor (refer to NeRF)
- n is the parameters in 59 dimensional gaussian, can also be density (e.g., from knn)
- 2 aspects of merging:
    1. if two points similar enough
    2. if two points locate at dense area
        - average distance between knn points
