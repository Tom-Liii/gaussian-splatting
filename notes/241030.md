# possible literature comparison
- c3dgs: gaussian volume mask, view-dependent color
- lightGaussian: identifies Gaussians that minimally contribute to scene reconstruction and employs a pruning and recovery process
- taiming 3dgs: use score to split or clone
- mini-splatting: optimize blur area and do simplification

# importance sampling
- choose point to merge from area with points with lower gradients
