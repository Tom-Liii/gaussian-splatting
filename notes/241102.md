0. Abstract
    1. Reducing the size of 3D Gaussian Splatting Point Cloud by View-Dependent Color and Merging
1. Intrduction
    1. View-Dependent Color: recolor, direction encoding, and mlp head
    2. Pre-Merge and Weight-Merge
2. Related Works
    1. 3DGS: 
    2. Compact 3DGS (c3dgs): gaussian volume mask, view-dependent color
    3. LightGaussian: identifies Gaussians that minimally contribute to scene reconstruction and employs a pruning and recovery process
    4. Mini-Splatting: optimize blur area and do simplification
    5. Taiming 3DGS: use score to split or clone
    5. Others (Maybe gauHuman (average merge))
3. Method
    - View-Dependent Color
        - replacing high order SH coefficients
    - Pre-Merge Stage
        - fps sampling (tentative)
        - xyz gradient accumulation
    - Merge Stage
        - optimizable merge weights
    - pseudo code for whole merge process:
        - obtain origianl 3dgs pre-training `gaussians`
        - while not converged do: 
            - stage 1: pre-merge stage
            - for `iteration` in `pre_merge_interval`:
                - randomly selected `p`% points in `gaussians` using `merge_group_indices`
                - optimize `xyz`, `opacity`, and so on
                - accumulated the gradient for xyz `xyz_grad_accum` for all iterations in `pre_merge_interval`
            - intermediate stage: 
                - keep `q`% points with least `xyz_grad_accum` in the `merge_group_indices`, and eliminate other items in `merge_group_indices`
            - stage 2: merge stage
            - for `iteration` in `merge_interval`: 
                - if `iteration` == 0: 
                    - initialize `merge_weight` for points in `merge_group_indices`
                - if `iteration` < `merge_interval - 1`: 
                    - do `pseudo_merge_and_render`
                - else if: 
                    - do `final_merge`
                - optimize `xyz`, `opacity`, `merge_weight`, and so on 
4. Experiment
    1. Comparison
        - merge based on 3dgs, c3dgs, lightGaussian pre-trainings
            - all 11 datasets
            - 2 types of comparison: 
                1. pre-training comparison
                    1. 3dgs, sh coefficient
                    2. load from c3dgs
                2. same gaussian points number: metrics comparison
    2. Ablation Study
        1. with pre-merge VS. without pre-merge
        2. different pre-training settings (on iterations, densify until, and so on)
        3. with pre-merge VS. randomly pruning points
        4. with fps selection VS. without fps selection
        5. selected by smallest gradients VS. by sampling
5. Conclusion (tentative)
    1. Well performance on reducing the number of gaussian points while sustain a high PSNR score
    2. long training time (due to the need for optimizing merge weight)
