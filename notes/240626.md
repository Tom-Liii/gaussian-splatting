# More on merging
- Current: 
    1. Train 30000 iterations, and then merge 30000 iterations
    2. Randomly pick points to merge
    3. Each merge will merge 2 points
- Future direction: 
    1. Mixed training and merging
    2. Other picking mechanism (similarity-based approaches)
    3. Different merging numbers rather than 2 (e.g., 3, 4, 5, ...)
    4. Sparse Matrix 59: dimension 
        - DL: dictionary learning
        - training than dictionary learning?
        - how to restore to original?
    5. new loss, split into 16*16 patch, and calculate covariance, make it smaller, to make every area reconstruct better

# Discussion
## New Loss Function
## Sparse Matrix Reconstrcution
## Removal of Outliers
## Reason for Blurring
- too sparse
