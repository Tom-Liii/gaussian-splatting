## Rendering, Geometry, and Generalization
- 3D world: how to represent 3D
- 2D display
- bridge
- application: robotics, AR / VR, VTX
### 1. Rendering: Mip-Splatting
- 3dgs more precise than NeRF
- viewer for 3dgs
- strong aliasing artifacts when zoom-in or zoom-out
- aliasing happens when a continuous signal is sampled at a rate that is too low
- dilation: enlarge the pixel
- needle-shape
- solution: 
    - 3D smoothing filter: reduce the needle-shape artifacts
    - 2D Mip Filter: apply normalization to Gaussian
### 2. Geometry: 2DGS for geometrically accurate RF
- overlapping in gaussians
- huge variance between different camera points
- inaccurate projection (approximation): perspective distortion
- solution:
    - surfels representation
    - ray-splat intersect: is not projection
    - regularization terms: regularize the intersection
- smoother surface
### 3. Generalization: LaRa
- 4 views for 360 degree
- goal: to make large-baseline reconstruction
- supports both single image and text inputs:
    - reasoning + video + mesh < 2 secs
- MVSNeRF
- Transformer: too expensive
- RF prediction

## Gaussians Surfels
- geometry surface
- scene understanding, education, games, 3D video
- NeuS: slow, over-smoothing
- 3DGS: efficient & expressive, poor geometry
- Gaussian Surfels: improve geometry
- 3DGS -> flatten -> surfels (surface elements)
- 3DGS: eliminating geometric ambiguity
    - use gaussian center to approximate
- depth-normal consistency
- 3DGS: very local, in some highlight areas -> densification -> poor geometry
- normal prior
- volumetric cutting: remove erronuous depth around edges
- BlendedMVS Dataset: on github
