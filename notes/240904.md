# TODO
1. Design more reasonable gaussian point pre-selection (core)
    - Method 1: only select point that its neighborhood (use radius to define its neighborhood, similar to DBSCAN) has more than a certain number of points
    - Method 2: use significance score like other implementation
2. Implement merge that allows multiple gaussian points (core) [DONE]
    1. kdtree that return its nearest k neighbors
    2. iterating on multiple weights for each point
    3. merge multiple points
3. **Explore more efficient data compressing method, especially for color compression** [DONE]
    - try view-dependent color from Compact3DGS
4. Determine the main factor of compression (color, merge) [DONE]
5. **Ensure generalization (first priority)** [DONE]
    - test on multiple datasets

## Design more reasonable gaussian point pre-selection
1. feature based selection, prune sparse area, select dense area
2. set multiple branches for each merge, trace the psnr, mix the points with best performance
