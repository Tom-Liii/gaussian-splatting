# Analysis on Compact 3DGS
## Color Representation: View-dependent color
```
Compact view-dependent color. The proposed color representation based on the neural field offers more than a
threefold improvement in storage efficiency with a slightly
reduced number of Gaussians compared to the directly storing high-degree SH, despite necessitating slightly more
time for training and rendering. Nonetheless, when compared to 3DGS, the proposed color representation with the
masking strategy demonstrates either a faster or comparable
rendering speed.
